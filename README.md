hi; im not the best developer in javascript, but im still pretty good.
this [code](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/acapzine/nodejs-cardgame/main/main.js) is **not** my original code for this, but im pretty sure it'll still work
if you want the original head [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/acapzine/nodejs-cardgame/main/b.js)

if you for some reason dont have node install in your computer (who doesnt have node installed??) and want to run this, [here](https://replit.com/@acapzine/nodejs-cardgame)'s a replit link to go use it

thanks,
u1terior
